**Abstract** 

In vaccine trials with long-term patient follow-up, it is of great importance to identify surrogate markers that accurately infer treatment effects. These markers offer practical advantages, such as earlier observation or cost-effectiveness, and can accelerate vaccine development while serving as biomarkers for precision medicine. High-throughput technologies like RNA-sequencing have emerged as promising tools for understanding complex biological systems and informing new treatment strategies. However, these data are high-dimensional, presenting unique statistical challenges for existing surrogate marker identification methods. We introduce Rank-based Identification of high-dimensional SurrogatE Markers (RISE), a novel approach designed for small sample, high-dimensional settings typical in modern vaccine experiments. RISE employs a non-parametric univariate test to screen variables for promising candidates, followed by surrogate evaluation on independent data. Our simulation studies demonstrate RISE's desirable properties, including type one error rate control and empirical power under various conditions. Applying RISE to an Ebolavirus vaccination clinical trial (PREVAC - NCT02876328), we sought to identify genes whose post-vaccination expression could serve as surrogates for long-term vaccine response. This analysis revealed a 12-gene signature whose day 7 post-vaccination appears to be a reasonable surrogate for the Ebolavirus glycoprotein-specific binding antibody response at 12 months post-vaccination.
